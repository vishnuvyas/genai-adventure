# Welcome Readers

Hello, Dear Readers! I'm starting a journey into Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI. As I learn, I'll share my thoughts and experiences with you. From reading research papers and testing applications, to attempting to build my own AI models, we will explore this field together.

This blog is where I document my learning. There may be detours and surprises along the way, but that's part of the process. 

Whether you're already familiar with AI or just curious about it, I invite you to join me. Let's embark on this journey into the world of LLMs and generative AI together!

Why am I doing this, you might ask? There are several reasons. First, I want to hold myself accountable. By sharing my journey, I’m making a commitment to myself and you, my readers, to continuously learn and grow in this field.

Second, your feedback and comments are incredibly valuable. By inviting discussion, I hope to gain new perspectives, critique, and insight that will undoubtedly enrich my understanding. I’m not just sharing my learning journey, but opening up a space for us to learn from each other.

Finally, there’s something exhilarating about building in public. It’s a challenge, it’s rewarding, and it’s a testament to the power of shared knowledge and collaboration. So, here we are, at the beginning of this exciting journey. I can’t wait to see where it takes us.

In summary, I’m setting off on a journey into the world of Large Language Models and generative AI, and I’d love for you to tag along. This blog is going to be like my travel journal, jotting down everything I learn. And by putting it all out here, it’s a way for me to stay on track and spark some cool discussions.

Having you along for the ride, sharing your thoughts and ideas, will make this whole thing even better. I’m really stoked about diving into AI and seeing where this journey takes us. Thanks for being a part of this. Here’s to the adventure ahead in the AI universe!
